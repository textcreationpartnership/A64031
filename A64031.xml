            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRUE RELATION Of ſundry paſſages in and about the moſt honourable Houſe of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Munday the third of this inſtant month of <hi>January,</hi> his <hi>Majeſty</hi> by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant under his own hand, Authorized Sergeant <hi>Frances,</hi> Sergeant at Armes, to come to the Houſe of Commons, and there to demand Mr. <hi>Denzill Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerigg,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Strowd,</hi> whom in his <hi>Majeſties</hi> name, he accuſed of High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Commons returned this anſwere, that not only thoſe five Gentlemen, but alſo every one of them would lay downe their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes at his <hi>Majeſties</hi> feet, ſo he would be but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accuſe them in a legall way, and make known the cauſe of their Accuſation.</p>
            <p>The next day being Tueſday, his <hi>Majeſty</hi> (unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly) came to the Houſe of Commons attended with a multitude of perſons Armed as aforeſaid, and there in the SPEAKERS Chaire, demanded theſe five Perſons, ſaying he expected yeſterday o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38063:2"/>and not an Anſwere: When his <hi>Majeſty</hi> a long time together had caſt his eyes round about the Houſe, and could not diſcerne any of theſe five Members there, he was pleaſed to command Mr. Speaker to tell him if they were there, the Speaker falling upon his knees humbly beſeeching his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi> to excuſe him, for he was ſervant to the Houſe of Commons, and could neither ſee nor ſpeake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their leave.</p>
            <p>His Majeſtie diſcerning they were not in the Houſe, graciouſly departed; but the bloody min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſouldiers, ſome of whom ſtood neere the doore of the Houſe of Commons, with their Piſtols readie cockt, and their Swords erected in their hands, expecting when the word ſhould have beene given with fearefull Oathes expreſſed themſelves, that they loſt that they came for, the perſons were not there, they miſt the opportunity of cutting their throats, and the throats of all thoſe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men of the Houſe of Commons that would not have ſuffered theſe five perſons to have beene taken out of the Houſe, his Majeſties owne ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants carrying themſelves civilly, and indeed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Trayterous deſigne.</p>
            <p>As ſoone as theſe damme blades about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 400. were gone, the Houſe of Commons, full of griefe of heart to ſee the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus broken, adjourned in great diſcontent til Wedneſday, the 5. of Januarie, at two of the clock, at which time they met, and concluded of an Order to adjourne the Houſe till Tuſeday, the 11. of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1641. And in the meane time, appointed a Comittee of the Houſe of Commons to ſit in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38063:3"/>to conſider of the ſafety of the King, Kingdome and Parliament, and of repairing of the priviledges of <hi>Parliament</hi> ſo highly broken.</p>
            <p>Which meeting hath produced ſeverall Orders and Declarations for maintaining the priviledges of Parliament, which are to be reported to the Houſe, and there to have it's force.</p>
            <p>But for the ſafety of the Kingdome and Citie, which they conceived to be in emminent danger; the Committee for Iriſh affaires of the Houſe of Commons propounded the conſideration thereof to the Committee of the Lords Houſe for Iriſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, who ſate likewiſe in <hi>London,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the King had denyed both houſes a Guard to protect them; and in regard ſuch an hoſtill plot was intended, as was apparantly proved declared their opinion, that whereas the King and Parliament was in ſo great danger; that in that caſe the Sheriffes of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Midleſex,</hi> ought to come with the <hi>Poſſe Commitatus,</hi> to the Parliament to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the King and Parliament, to which opinion the Comittee of the Houſe of Commons aſſented, which was communicated to the Lord Major, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and Common Counſell of <hi>London,</hi> and they delivered their opinions herein, and expreſſed their forwardneſſe hereunto.</p>
            <p>This breach of priviledge of Parliament begot much diſcontent in the Parliament and people, and the more in regard by ſpeciall command, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt Maſter <hi>Pym,</hi> and the reſt was printed, and the ſame publiſhed by Sir <hi>William Killegrue</hi> and Sir <hi>William Flemyn,</hi> and delivered in his Majeſties Name (as they faſely pretended) to the foure Innes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38063:3"/>of Court, to the end to make theſe perſons the more odious to them and the Kingdome: And in regard the conſequence of admitting this Accuſation in this manner againſt theſe five perſons, is a preſident to take away the whole Houſe of Commons at a breath, under pretence of high Treaſon, if (as God forbid) an Accunſation of this nature ſhould be hereafter; and conſidering that to this very day, (11. Januar. 1641.) no Articles of Impeachment is come into the Houſe of Commons by the Kings Attourney or otherwiſe, or from the Lords Houſe (if any be there againſt them) till which time that it come from thence by meſſengers of their owne (if their firſt depending) the Houſe cannot legally take notice thereof: This, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reaſons, made the Houſe of Commons to inſiſt upon it, beſides the great merit of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom (as the houſe hath declared) though as deare as their lives unto them, they will deliver over unto a tryall, ſo as his Majeſtie will proceed againſt them in a legall way, either at the Kings Bench, or in Parliament, and produce any Subject in England that will ſtand to make good the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in caſe they faile to make it good, that his Majectie will let them be forth-comming, and alſo to diſcover thoſe wicked Counſells that have adviſed him to this courſe, that they may be brought to condigne puniſhment.</p>
            <p>The City ond people in the adjacent parts are ſo much moved in this buſineſſe, and fearing ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine execution may be done upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> (both the Houſe of Peeres, and Houſe of Commons, and the Lords of the Privy Counſell, having decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

The Trayned Bands in <hi>Southwark</hi> have offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſecure all the other ſide of the water, and the Aprentices tendred their ſervices to attend the Parliament to the number of ten thouſand with Warlike weapons, but thoſe the Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to ſtay at home. And laſtly, the Watermen tendred their Barges for more ſafety to carry the Parliament men by Water: All which to the great admiration of all the Beholders, put in execution this day: And that which is moſt conſiderable, 4000 Horſemen are come to the houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons this day, except ſome of them which lay at <hi>Vxbridg</hi> and places thereabouts, with a Petition in the name of the whole County of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> that <hi>Mr. Hampden</hi> their Knight of the Shire may receive his Tryall, and not lie under the name of high Treaſon, and cannot obtaine a legall way of Tryall, and that if he acquit himſelfe (as no good men make doubt of) Juſtice in a high meaſure may be done upon the falſe informers of his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> how neere or how
