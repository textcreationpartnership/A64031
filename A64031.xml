            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Hou≈øe of Commons returned this an≈øwere, that not only tho≈øe five Gentlemen, but al≈øo every one of them would lay downe their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes at his <hi>Maje≈øties</hi> feet, ≈øo he would be but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed to accu≈øe them in a legall way, and make known the cau≈øe of their Accu≈øation.</p>
            <p>The next day being Tue≈øday, his <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> (unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly) came to the Hou≈øe of Commons attended with a multitude of per≈øons Armed as afore≈øaid, and there in the SPEAKERS Chaire, demanded the≈øe five Per≈øons, ≈øaying he expected ye≈øterday o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38063:2"/>and not an An≈øwere: When his <hi>Maje≈øty</hi> a long time together had ca≈øt his eyes round about the Hou≈øe, and could not di≈øcerne any of the≈øe five Members there, he was plea≈øed to command Mr. Speaker to tell him if they were there, the Speaker falling upon his knees humbly be≈øeeching his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty</hi> to excu≈øe him, for he was ≈øervant to the Hou≈øe of Commons, and could neither ≈øee nor ≈øpeake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their leave.</p>
            <p>His Maje≈øtie di≈øcerning they were not in the Hou≈øe, graciou≈øly departed; but the bloody min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ≈øouldiers, ≈øome of whom ≈øtood neere the doore of the Hou≈øe of Commons, with their Pi≈øtols readie cockt, and their Swords erected in their hands, expecting when the word ≈øhould have beene given with fearefull Oathes expre≈ø≈øed them≈øelves, that they lo≈øt that they came for, the per≈øons were not there, they mi≈øt the opportunity of cutting their throats, and the throats of all tho≈øe Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men of the Hou≈øe of Commons that would not have ≈øuffered the≈øe five per≈øons to have beene taken out of the Hou≈øe, his Maje≈øties owne ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants carrying them≈øelves civilly, and indeed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Trayterous de≈øigne.</p>
            <p>As ≈øoone as the≈øe damme blades about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 400. were gone, the Hou≈øe of Commons, full of griefe of heart to ≈øee the priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus broken, adjourned in great di≈øcontent til Wedne≈øday, the 5. of Januarie, at two of the clock, at which time they met, and concluded of an Order to adjourne the Hou≈øe till Tu≈øeday, the 11. of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1641. And in the meane time, appointed a Comittee of the Hou≈øe of Commons to ≈øit in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38063:3"/>to con≈øider of the ≈øafety of the King, Kingdome and Parliament, and of repairing of the priviledges of <hi>Parliament</hi> ≈øo highly broken.</p>
            <p>Which meeting hath produced ≈øeverall Orders and Declarations for maintaining the priviledges of Parliament, which are to be reported to the Hou≈øe, and there to have it's force.</p>
            <p>But for the ≈øafety of the Kingdome and Citie, which they conceived to be in emminent danger; the Committee for Iri≈øh affaires of the Hou≈øe of Commons propounded the con≈øideration thereof to the Committee of the Lords Hou≈øe for Iri≈øh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, who ≈øate likewi≈øe in <hi>London,</hi> who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the King had denyed both hou≈øes a Guard to protect them; and in regard ≈øuch an ho≈øtill plot was intended, as was apparantly proved declared their opinion, that whereas the King and Parliament was in ≈øo great danger; that in that ca≈øe the Sheriffes of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Midle≈øex,</hi> ought to come with the <hi>Po≈ø≈øe Commitatus,</hi> to the Parliament to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the King and Parliament, to which opinion the Comittee of the Hou≈øe of Commons a≈ø≈øented, which was communicated to the Lord Major, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen and Common Coun≈øell of <hi>London,</hi> and they delivered their opinions herein, and expre≈ø≈øed their forwardne≈ø≈øe hereunto.</p>
            <p>This breach of priviledge of Parliament begot much di≈øcontent in the Parliament and people, and the more in regard by ≈øpeciall command, the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles again≈øt Ma≈øter <hi>Pym,</hi> and the re≈øt was printed, and the ≈øame publi≈øhed by Sir <hi>William Killegrue</hi> and Sir <hi>William Flemyn,</hi> and delivered in his Maje≈øties Name (as they fa≈øely pretended) to the foure Innes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38063:3"/>of Court, to the end to make the≈øe per≈øons the more odious to them and the Kingdome: And in regard the con≈øequence of admitting this Accu≈øation in this manner again≈øt the≈øe five per≈øons, is a pre≈øident to take away the whole Hou≈øe of Commons at a breath, under pretence of high Trea≈øon, if (as God forbid) an Accun≈øation of this nature ≈øhould be hereafter; and con≈øidering that to this very day, (11. Januar. 1641.) no Articles of Impeachment is come into the Hou≈øe of Commons by the Kings Attourney or otherwi≈øe, or from the Lords Hou≈øe (if any be there again≈øt them) till which time that it come from thence by me≈ø≈øengers of their owne (if their fir≈øt depending) the Hou≈øe cannot legally take notice thereof: This, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other rea≈øons, made the Hou≈øe of Commons to in≈øi≈øt upon it, be≈øides the great merit of the≈øe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, whom (as the hou≈øe hath declared) though as deare as their lives unto them, they will deliver over unto a tryall, ≈øo as his Maje≈øtie will proceed again≈øt them in a legall way, either at the Kings Bench, or in Parliament, and produce any Subject in England that will ≈øtand to make good the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øation, and in ca≈øe they faile to make it good, that his Majectie will let them be forth-comming, and al≈øo to di≈øcover tho≈øe wicked Coun≈øells that have advi≈øed him to this cour≈øe, that they may be brought to condigne puni≈øhment.</p>
            <p>The City ond people in the adjacent parts are ≈øo much moved in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, and fearing ≈øome ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine execution may be done upon the <hi>Parliament</hi> (both the Hou≈øe of Peeres, and Hou≈øe of Commons, and the Lords of the Privy Coun≈øell, having decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
